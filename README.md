# M602BComputerProgramming

Classwork and practice

# Description

Python and C++ are the primary programming languages of many software projects. In this
module, students will learn the foundations of Python and C++ programming together with
their well-known libraries. Furthermore, students will learn to implement programs in practice
using these programming languages.

# Objectives

Specific objectives include
 To evaluate core concepts of Python and C++ programming.
 To build Python and C++ projects in action.

# Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of the module, students will be able to
1. Critically evaluate the business contexts that can benefit from Python and C++ programming.
2. Critically analyze core Python and C++ programming concepts, including their basic
and object-oriented structures.
3. Critically build Python and C++ projects for various problems.

# Teaching Methods

Students will engage in learning through a series of directed study activities, lectures, and
self-study. The teaching sessions will be divided into two parts. The first part belongs to an
interactive lecture, where students learn about theoretical aspects of the presented topic. The
second part will be an interactive lab, where students will implement the presented concepts
themselves under the guidance of the tutor. Students will be also directed to online materials
for further study.
